Programming makes up most of what I do that is meaningful, I usually code in lower-level systems langauges like C++ or Rust and use Java for work.
My main interests revolve around simulations, and have turned towards the graphical end, where my projects are(will be) centered around 3D graphics programming.
I currently work as a remote data integration and software developer part time at Ventriks.
