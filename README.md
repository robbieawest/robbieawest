Programming makes up most of what I do that is meaningful, I develop mostly in lower-level languages, currently use Odin for personal projects and Java for work.
My main interests revolve around simulations, and have turned towards the graphical end, where my current projects are centered around 3D graphics programming.
I work as a remote data integration and software developer part time at Ventriks.
