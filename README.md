Programming makes up most of what I do that is meaningful, I usually code in lower-level systems langauges like Odin or C++ and use Java for work.
My main interests revolve around simulations, and have turned towards the graphical end, where my current projects are centered around 3D graphics programming.
I work as a remote data integration and software developer part time at Ventriks.
